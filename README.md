## Usage
* **View**

  View is a user interface display that contains object components that can be seen or interacted with by the user
* **Protocol**

  A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.
